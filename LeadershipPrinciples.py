1. Customer Obsession - Do you know what your custmer wants
    In my previous role, I developed process graphics and one of the responsibilities was with meeting an operator at a client refinery site 
    to go through the process graphics that we had developed. Now we develop these HMI graphics based on technical documents, in meeting with
    the client's corporate and site standards, including color, shapes etc. So on this particular day, the operator asked if we could replace
    one shape with another shape. The shape he wanted was to be used for very specific situations according to the corporate standards. So I
    enquired about why he wanted the other shape. He said it was because the other shape had color. Color would indicate to other operators 
    that a shape could be clicked for bring up options. So even though the current shape could be clicked to change a state, without a color,
    it wasnt clear to the operators that was so. So what I did was bring up some color combinations for on/off state that were already defined
    in the corporate standards, the operator chose and we defined a new style class for that color combination, and added the color to the
    text box to indicate to the other operators that they could change the state of the pump using the text box. I was able to avoid 
    escalating the issue to my manager; found solution that my customer, the operator, found satisfying and I just made the required changes
    on the other graphics.

    -Frustrated with a Client - when I developed Safeviw configuration for a refinery site, my company was actually a sub-contractor on the
    project so I would often develop based on what the contractor asked, only for the customer to be shown this file and then decide on
    a new direction. This was frustrating because I would be repeating work simply because we were not in direct contact with the client 
    most of the time, we were in contact with the contractor. So I decided to always provide options. For example we would typically have the
    screen divided into four quadrants with one process graphic in each quadrant. So when the contractor would say to add a single window for
    trends, I would do that of course, but I would actually start from a template of having four trend windows, one for each process graphic,
    make the contractor aware of these options so that if the customer decided they wanted four or three, at least we would have something to
    show them so they can make a final decision.

2. Ownership - Big picture
    In my previous role, consistency in process graphics was a big deal. Often we would have multiple junior engineers work on a graphic set
    for a client. So in this particular situation I was developing the graphics with another engineer and for a particular alarm shape, I was
    consistently putting them on the right of a pump, the other engineer was consistently putting them on the left, (the corporate guide wasnt
    specific). So we would often send screenshots of the graphics to the client to show progress. So when I was preparing this document, I 
    realized the inconsistency, I notified the senior engineer and proceeded to make the changes to ensure consistency. Because the screenshots
    needed to be sent out that day, I knew this would mean staying longer than I had anticipated, but I didnt mind taking ownership of 
    producing consistent graphics. We also made a note to tell the customer to specify a particular placement of alarm shapes.

3. Invent and Simplify
    So when I came to graduate school, I was the second student to work with my graduate professor and as such, there was a lot of self-learning.
    I had to learn to operate lab equipment, contact customer support if I couldnt find an answer etc. To help me and future students in the
    lab, I started a word document manual of how-to's for every piece of equipment I used in my experiments. So for an HPLC, electron microscope 
    etc and whenever I came into new information of how to fix a problem, or carry out something peculiar I would make sure to write it down
    and add it to the word document. These documents were all stored on dropbox account (for the lab), so that future student would have access.

4. Are Right, A Lot
    In my previous role, consistency in process graphics was a big deal. Often we would have multiple junior engineers work on a graphic set
    for a client. So in this particular situation I was developing the graphics with another engineer and for a particular alarm shape, I was
    consistently putting them on the right of a pump, the other engineer was consistently putting them on the left, (the corporate guide wasnt
    specific). So we would often send screenshots of the graphics to the client to show progress. So when I was preparing this document, I 
    realized the inconsistency, I notified the senior engineer and proceeded to make the changes to ensure consistency. Because the screenshots
    needed to be sent out that day, I knew this would mean staying longer than I had anticipated, but I didnt mind taking ownership of 
    producing consistent graphics. We also made a note to tell the customer to specify a particular placement of alarm shapes.


    -Mistake question: During the pandemic, a lot of projects were being moved up a lot and I was on this one project, where my company was
    a sub-contractor and we would receive emails from the contractor with comments about changes that needed to be made. Anyway, on one
    particular morning I saw an email from the contractor about certain changes that needed to be made and the manager for that project was
    copied on the email. When I got to work, I was told that I had been moved to a different project. I got in touch with the new manager I
    was going to be working with and I only asked if the other manager was aware that I had been moved. Of course he was, since these
    decisions are made in the managers' meetings. So I moved on to the new project and started work. My mistake was not sending an email or
    even meeting with the manager of the previous project to ensure that he had seen the email and that he needed to either check with the
    new manager so that I could handle those changes or ensure he had another person handle those changes. Anyway, since that project was
    sort of on hold for a while, the manager actually assumed that I made the new changes before switching to the new project. Those changes
    almost fell through the cracks. We only realized it in a passing conversation we had later on and I asked permission from the manager of
    my current project to make those changes. I realized that not directly checking with the manager of the old project was a mistake and 
    from then on, I made sure to send an email with a list of tasks that were still pending to a manager whenever I switched projects.

5. Learn And Be Curious
    In my previous role, to stay abreast with current trends I subscribed to the leading industry magazine so that I could have a personal
    copy. This became handy during the pandaemic when I didnt have access to the company copy. Anyway, we have a product for advanced process
    control which I realized from reading the magazines, could be adapted to providing a predictive maintance product, so I mentioned it to
    my manager, and the advanced process team was made aware of this idea, so they could explore it. At the time I was leaving, it was still
    on their list of ideas to explore after the product really took off for the current use.

6. Hire and Develop the best
    I havent been in a hiring role, ever, but I have mentored undergrads as a graduate students. And in order to develop them, I shared by
    resuources with them, and made myself available for questions, and assistance.

7. Insist On the Highest Standards
    In my previous role, consistency in process graphics was a big deal. Often we would have multiple junior engineers work on a graphic set
    for a client. So in this particular situation I was developing the graphics with another engineer and for a particular alarm shape, I was
    consistently putting them on the right of a pump, the other engineer was consistently putting them on the left, (the corporate guide wasnt
    specific). So we would often send screenshots of the graphics to the client to show progress. So when I was preparing this document, I 
    realized the inconsistency, I notified the senior engineer and proceeded to make the changes to ensure consistency. Because the screenshots
    needed to be sent out that day, I knew this would mean staying longer than I had anticipated, but I didnt mind taking ownership of 
    producing consistent graphics. We also made a note to tell the customer to specify a particular placement of alarm shapes.    

    When I developed Safeviw configuration for a refinery site, my company was actually a sub-contractor on the project so I would often 
    develop based on what the contractor asked, only for the customer to be shown this file and then decide on a new direction. So in order to
    to give the customer the best possible product I could come up with, with every request I got from the contractor, I would draw on my
    experience in developing Safeviw files for other sites and develop a separate file with options I think the customer might want,in addition
    to the file that meets the contractor's specifications. This way, the contractor was able to bring multiple ideas to the client, start a 
    conversation and give the client the best possible option.


8. Think Big
    Frankly speaking, deciding to make a career switch to software engineering is the biggest calculated risk. When I made the decision, I 
    made a plan to spend 6-10 hours a week learning backend engineering with Django, created projects and all the while I knew that I would
    need to take time out to prepare for the coding interviews, so I started to save aggressively. When I completed my projects, I quit my
    job, and started preparing for data structures and algorithms. This risk was calculated because I researched how long it took other people 
    who have taken this step, to prepare for the interviews and made sure that I had some extra months of savings done. I didnt know what the
    future held, but I was determined to have a career that utilized my greatest strengths and for which I had a passion. Self learning is not
    a straight path; its made up of constantly figuring out the next step and doing the research and finding a viable option. Self learing has
    been a journey of small victories and it is these victories that have strengthened my conviction to always listen to my guts instincts and 
    I intend to bring this same conviction to developing my career.


9. Bias For Action
    In my previous role, consistency in process graphics was a big deal. Often we would have multiple junior engineers work on a graphic set
    for a client. So in this particular situation I was developing the graphics with another engineer and for a particular alarm shape, I was
    consistently putting them on the right of a pump, the other engineer was consistently putting them on the left, (the corporate guide wasnt
    specific). So we would often send screenshots of the graphics to the client to show progress. So when I was preparing this document, I 
    realized the inconsistency, I notified the senior engineer and proceeded to make the changes to ensure consistency. I didnt wait for the
    client to make a decision before proceeding, I made the call, and in the next meeting with the client, I made sure to bring up the 
    inconsistency. In this case, the client went with my decision and we amended the design document to include specifically stating to put
    pumps on the right of pumps. This action didnt need extensive study and waiting on the client because had the client decided otherwise,
    reversing the decision would be fairly easy to do.

    In my previous role, I developed process graphics and one of the responsibilities was with meeting an operator at a client refinery site 
    to go through the process graphics that we had developed. Now we develop these HMI graphics based on technical documents, in meeting with
    the client's corporate and site standards, including color, shapes etc. So on this particular day, the operator asked if we could replace
    one shape with another shape. The shape he wanted was to be used for very specific situations according to the corporate standards. So I
    enquired about why he wanted the other shape. He said it was because the other shape had color and color would indicate to other operators 
    that the shape could be clicked to bring up options. So even though the current shape could be clicked to change a state, without a color,
    it wasnt clear to the operators that was so. So what I did was bring up some color combinations for on/off state that were already defined
    in the corporate standards, the operator chose and we defined a new style class for that color combination. After making that call I
    informed my manager and later when we had a meeting with the corporate rep, I informed of this decision and they were fine with it. I was
    able to make a decision that was in keeping with the guidelines quickly before seeking permission. This way I didnt need to leave this
    decison for later which would have involved going back to the site in the future in order for the operator to approve the graphics again 
    with the corporate approved changes.

10. Frugality
    In grad school, I was the teaching assistant for a class that had a computer lab section where we took the students through the use of
    Aspen Plus. Now there was an existing manual for the class but I realised that as I was assisting, the students had questions that were
    not necessarily in the manual, so I would walk them through how to solve the issues they were facing. We didnt have enough time in the 
    class and students would often have to complete the exercises outside of class. I realized that a lot of these question were repeatedly 
    asked, so I start taking note of the questions asked during the session and the solutions found and decided to amend the manual after 
    each class and post the amended manual to Blackboard before the next class. This action had the effect of reducing the amount of time I 
    spent helping students out of class, thus making a frugal use of time.


11. Earn Trust
    So when I joined my previous company, the way I went about gaining trust with each team I joined was to share resources. So one engineer
    had asked me a question about how to configure some parameter for an old-school controller that he was working on. I didnt know the 
    answer, but I made sure to do the research along side him and share the resources on what we found. Some time later, I had a question that
    he didnt know the answer to, but I was surprised to see that he also took the time to research the manuals and actually found the answer
    before I did and shared it with me. 

12. Dive Deep
    So when I joined my previous company, we had a particular training to introduce new engineers to designing control logic and also to test
    the problem solving skills of the engineers. Now one engineer would do it at a time and the task was to design a small temperature 
    controller but the catch was that you were not necessarily taught what to do, you were directed to the resources and you had to discover
    the questions you had, and find the answers in the resources. Anyway, I really enjoyed this little exercise, so after I had designed my
    solution and finished with this exercise, I kept on studying how different control logic schemes were designed using the resources. 
    So typically, a junior engineer would build the graphics while a senior engineer builds the control logic scheme. Because I was diving 
    deep into the control logic side of things, I would often ask detailed questions about how and why the senior engineer made certain 
    choices. I learned a lot through this process and even got the opportunity to build data points and simple schemes such as device control
    logic for pumps while asking questions about more complex schemes.


13. Have a backbone; Disagree and Commit
    In my previous role, consistency in process graphics was a big deal. Often we would have multiple junior engineers work on a graphic set
    for a client. So in this particular situation I was developing the graphics with another engineer and for a particular alarm shape, I was
    consistently putting them on the right of a pump, the other engineer was consistently putting them on the left, (the corporate guide wasnt
    specific). So we would often send screenshots of the graphics to the client to show progress. So when I was preparing this document, I 
    realized the inconsistency, I notified the senior engineer and proceeded to make the changes to ensure consistency. At first, the senior 
    engineer didnt think that this was not a big deal but I was pretty convinced that ensuring that vital information was placed in the same
    place would aid quick response for operators. I told the senior engineer this and he actually agreed that it made sense, so I made the
    changes on the existing graphics and the other junior engineer was notified to put the alarm shapes on the right. We also made it a point
    to bring up this ambiguity up to the client before amending the design document.

14. Deliver Results
    So some time after graduate school, my old professor reached out to me about issues the new students were having on some experiments. She
    needed me to set up a call and walk the students through the problems. The results of that experiments were needed to complete a grant
    proposals and so even though I had graduated, I worked with the new students, even doing some research to find solutions. The experiments
    were completed on time, and a few months later, the grant was awarded.


15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer - Leaders have a vision for and a personal commitment to their employees' personal success
    In grad school, I was the teaching assistant for a class that had a computer lab section where we took the students through the use of
    Aspen Plus. Now there was an existing manual for the class but I realised that as I was assisting, the students had questions that were
    not necessarily in the manual, so I would walk them through how to solve the issues they were facing. We didnt have enough time in the 
    class and students would often have to complete the exercises outside of class. I realized that a lot of these question were repeatedly 
    asked, so I start taking note of the questions asked during the session and the solutions found and decided to amend the manual after 
    each class and post the amended manual to Blackboard before the next class. This action had the effect of reducing the amount of time I 
    spent helping students out of class, thus making a frugal use of time.

16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsiblity - Leaders always leave things better than how they found them
    In grad school, I was the teaching assistant for a class that had a computer lab section where we took the students through the use of
    Aspen Plus. Now there was an existing manual for the class but I realised that as I was assisting, the students had questions that were
